const project=[{title:"HR Portal",description:"This HR management full-stack web application is designed to maintain a hierarchical structure within a company, where every admin is also an employee, but not all employees are admins. The portal allows efficient monitoring and management of employee-related activities, including attendance, leave tracking, device allocation, and handling device & leave requests. It also features an announcements section for internal communication. Each employee is managed exclusively by their respective admin, as determined by the admin ID assigned to them. The system ensures streamlined operations and role-based access control across the organization."}]
